Topic: MAXHEAP
max-heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
Here the max-heap is built for characters of the names.


INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Enter any number of names. Eg. <name1><name2><name3>
The program will build the maxheap with the first name then insertion of other names take place letter by letter into the same heap and final maxheap is displayed.

DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT
Input-java MaxHeap <name1><name2><name3>
Example:
Input- java MaxHeap yogita swetha dekshitha
Output-
Max heap is:
y w s t t d k s t o h a a e g i h e i h a

CHALLENGES FACED 
We knew to build maxheap for one array, but here we were supposed to do for more than one set and insert each element into the array and build maxheap.

HOW WE FACED THE CHALLENGES
We were not knowing how to dynamically increase array size as we had to add new element each time and build maxheap for same.We tried different ways and then worked together as a team on this assignment. We compiled all our ideas and worked on the coding and then tested with different cases.

WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT
We learnt to work together coordinately. We got stronger in this concept of max heap.We also learnt how to dynamically allocate size for new element by using vector class in this assignment.
